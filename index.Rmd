I'm an **epidemiologist** and **data enthusiast** currently living in San Francisco, CA.

I love working with data in the healthcare field, but I'm most passionate about projects involving **observational studies**, **cancer** and **chronic disease** research, and **patient-centered** inniatives. I work mostly in R, but I'm also proficient in SQL and SAS.

I have a **Master of Public Health in epidemiology** from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology) in May of 2019, and have a **Bachelor of Science degree in microbiology and cell sciences** from the [University of Florida](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGLAS/MCY_BS/) (Go Gators!).
